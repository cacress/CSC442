## 🧠 Project Overview

### **What makes a show popular or critically acclaimed?**  
In this project, we set out to explore whether features of streaming content — such as genres, text metadata, and production countries — have a measurable correlation with how well a movie or show is received.

We worked with two datasets (Netflix and Hulu, mid-2022) and presented our findings through reports, a research poster, and presentations. The goal was to build a multi-faceted understanding of content metadata and its connection to audience ratings, TMDB popularity, and IMDB votes.

## 📊 Research Questions by Contributor

This collaborative project had three focused research paths:

- **Colby Cress** – Explored how genre combinations relate to content reception  
- **Rithik Kulkarni** – Analyzed text-based metrics (titles & descriptions) and their correlation with popularity  
- **Benjamin Uy** – Investigated the impact of production countries and related features on show/movie success  

Together, we synthesized these angles into a larger view of how streaming metadata reflects audience engagement and critical reception.
